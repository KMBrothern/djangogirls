# Keyasha's Django Girls Blog

### Django Girls Austin Workshop
I spent this saturday working with the wonderful ladies at Django Girls Austin through the create a blog tutorial from 
Django Girls.

I learned a lot this weekend about:
* Python
  *There are a ton a things to read about Python and a good place to begin is in the Docs!
    * [Python Docs](https://www.docs.python.org "Python Docs")
* Django 
  * Which is a framework that was created for Python, that allows you to do cool things rather quickly
    * [Django Docs](https://www.docs.djangoprojects.com "Django Docs")
* Github
  * Using github for version control of our code for our newly built blogs
* PythonAnywhere
  * Allows you to host, run and code python in the cloud!(per the website slogan of course)
    * [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com "PythonAnywhere's Homepage")
* Bootstrap
  * Allows for quick styling of webpages using templates using HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web
    * [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com "Bootstrap's Homepage")
* And much more!


###Takeaways
All in all I had a great weekend and a great start to learning more about Python and Django. There were times when I may have gotten
confused but instead of giving up, I would take a break, talk to my gifted rubber duck or read the docs. I am proud of myself for 
finishing the entire tutorial and if you'd like to see the finished project feel free to go to
